# Jeopardy Demo

This project is a small Jeopardy-style board meant for use at an in-person event. It uses HTML, CSS and React loaded via CDN and can be opened directly in a browser.

## Running

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Click any value to reveal the question and start a 10 second timer with a short beep when time runs out. Previously used cells are dimmed.

No build step or additional tools are required.
